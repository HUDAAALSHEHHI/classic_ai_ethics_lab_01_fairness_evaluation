🧠 Comprehensive Experiment Overview

This experiment investigates fairness and ethical evaluation in a binary income classification task using the Adult Census Dataset. The focus is on detecting and quantifying potential gender bias in machine learning predictions. Through preprocessing, model training, and fairness assessment, the study explores how algorithmic outcomes can unintentionally favor or disadvantage specific demographic groups.

✏️ Objective

To assess whether a supervised model trained on demographic and occupational features exhibits disparate impact between male and female individuals, and to identify measurable fairness gaps that can be mitigated using data or model-level interventions.

📘 Results

The model achieved an accuracy exceeding 80%, but fairness analysis revealed a noticeable gender-based disparity in positive income predictions. Male participants showed a higher rate of predicted “>50K” outcomes compared to females, confirming the presence of algorithmic bias. Visualization of prediction rates by gender further highlighted the imbalance in learned decision boundaries.

📗 Notes


Fairness analysis remains an essential part of AI governance and responsible modeling.


The observed bias does not necessarily imply intentional discrimination, but rather reflects historical and data-collection imbalances.


Mitigation can be performed using reweighting, bias-aware training, or incorporating fairness constraints during model optimization.


The experiment illustrates how transparency, accountability, and ethical auditing can strengthen trust in intelligent systems.
